# Option Pricing & Validation, and 1D VaR

## Overview
This Python script calculates option prices using the Black-Scholes model and validates them against QuantLib. It also performs sensitivity analysis, delta behavior checks, and evaluates spot price impacts. Additionally, the script computes the 1-day Value at Risk (VaR) based on historical market data.

## Features
- **Option Pricing**: Implements the Black-Scholes formula for call and put options.  
- **Validation**: Compares results with QuantLib and performs sensitivity checks.  
- **1D VaR Calculation**: Estimates risk exposure using historical shifts in market rates.  

## Dependencies
- Python libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `scipy`, `QuantLib`  

## Usage
Run the script to compute option prices, validate the model, and calculate 1-day VaR.
